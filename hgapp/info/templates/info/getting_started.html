            <h3>Step 1 - Read <a href="/wiki/rules/">The Rules</a></h3>
            <p>
                As the person introducing The Contract to your group, you will act as a rules resource.
                Read <a href="/wiki/rules/">The Players Guide</a> sequentially for a complete picture of how The Contract
                works.
            </p>
            <p>
                By the time you've read through the section on
                <a href="/wiki/Rules/4-running-contract/">Running The Contract</a>, you will be more than prepared to
                act as Game Master for your first session of The Contract.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Rules can be easily referenced from anywhere on the site via the search box or dropdown menu in the
                upper toolbar.
            </p>

            <h3>Step 2 - Prepare to GM</h3>
            <p>
                <b class="lead">Gather your Players</b>, and pitch them on the idea of playing The Contract. Link them
                to the website, and let them explore the game for themselves. Each Player should
                <a href="{% url 'characters:characters_create'%}">Create a Contractor</a> before you start the first Game.
                This can be done either together in a session-zero or asynchronously, and it's a good time to start
                <a href="/wiki/Rules/4-running-contract/b-contractor-introductions/">Contractor introductions</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b class="lead">Read a Stock Scenario.</b> One Stock Scenario is available for free without an account
                <a href="/games/view/s/41/">here</a>. To access the other Stock Scenario, you must
                {% if not user.is_authenticated %}
                    <a href="{% url 'account_signup' %}">Sign up</a>, and

            </p>
            <p>
                <b class="lead">Optional: Organize a Cell.</b> Cells are a website feature that allows you to easily
                track your setting, your Players, their Contractors, and the Games they've played.
                <a href="{% url 'cells:cells_create' %}">Click here</a> to start a cell. Once you do, you can invite your
                Players (if they've made accounts), and they can declare your new Cell as their Contractors' home Cell.
                As Cell Leader, you can record Games that have already occurred, help your Players manage their Character
                Sheets, and edit your Cell's Setting.
            </p>
            <h3>Step 3 -  Run a Game</h3>
            <p>
                If you've read <a href="/wiki/rules/">The Guide</a> and <a href="/games/view/s/41/">the Stock Scenario</a>,
                you are more than ready to run your first Game. Get your Players togther and have at it.
            </p>
            <h3>Step 4 - Record your Game</h3>
                <p>
                    <a href="{% url 'games:games_enter_game' %}">
                        Recording the Games you play
                    </a> unlocks the full potential of The Contract's website. Declaring the outcome
                    gets you far more than an easily accessible record of who played which Contractors in which Scenarios.

                <li>Players are notified that their Contractors have Gifts and Experience to spend</li>

                <li>The source of all Experience / Gifts expended is recorded on their Character Sheets</li>
                <li>The GM receives their Rewards and is given an UI for allocating them to their Contractors</li>

                <li>Contractors whose stats or Powers exceed their Rewards are flagged so GMs can vet them for shenanigans</li>
