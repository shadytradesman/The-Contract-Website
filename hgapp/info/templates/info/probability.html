                When a Character attempts an action that is risky or has an unclear outcome, the GM will call for a roll.
                They name an Attribute, an Ability, and a Difficulty, and the Player rolls a number of ten-sided dice
                (d10s) equal to the sum of their Character's ratings in the named Attribute and Ability. Each die that lands on
                a number equal to or greater than the Difficulty is considered a Success. The Player adds up how many Successes
                they scored. A die showing '1' is called a "botch" and subtracts a Success. A die showing a '10' is called
                a "double" and is worth two Successes instead of one. The total number of Successes is called the Outcome
                and determines the result.

                What do I do with this information?
            </h3>
            <p>
                GMs should <b>not</b> reference the above visualization at game-time when calling for a roll. If a roll
                must be made, default to the standard Difficulty of 6 (or the
                <a href="/guide/rules/#weapons">weapon's Difficulty</a> for an attack). If the context of the
                action seems like it would significantly affect the odds, add or subtract one or two Difficulty as
                desired.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you call for a roll, you are not judging the difficulty of the task at hand so much as <b>you are
                entering an agreement with the Player about how much discretion you will have over the outcome.</b>
                Notice that botches, partial successes, and exceptional successes all allow the GM to determine the
                specifics of the outcome. A partial success (the most common Outcome) can be anything from a near-failure
                to a success with a complication. The Contract's emphasis on outside-the-box problem solving
                necessitates putting such trust and power in the hands of the GM. A more rigid resolution system would
                feel restrictive and arbitrary when things inevitably go off the rails. GMs should use the leeway
                afforded to guide the action of the Game. Tastes vary from GM to GM and World to World, but Players should
                never feel cheated. A complete success is a complete success.
            </p>
            <p>
                This system gives the GM some control over the "tone" of the game during the standard play,
                however, <b>during Combat-- when Contractors' lives are on the line-- the GM's discretion is greatly
                reduced.</b> Partial and exceptional successes have specific outcomes determined by the
                <a href="/guide/rules/#combat">Combat rules.</a> This makes The Contract's quick, deadly Combat more
                tactical and fair.
            </p>

            <h4>
                Why max out at 12 dice?
            </h4>
            <p>
                The Contract's <a href="/guide/further-reading/#design-philosophy">Design Philosophy</a>
                de-emphasises advancement through dice bonuses and Difficulty modifiers. Dice bonuses from multiple
                sources do not stack. This means that dice pools remain relatively small. Beyond 12 dice, consider
                success a near-certainty even on high Difficulty rolls.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>
                Show me the math!
            </h4>
            <p>
                Dice pool probabilities that account for botches (and doubles) seem fairly difficult to calculate, but
                it is essentially a standard
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_distribution">multinomial distribution</a> problem.
                See <a href="https://github.com/shadytradesman/dice-probabilities"> this Github repo</a> for the exact
                code used to generate the probabilities. There may be some very slight abnormalities resulting from
                rounding and computers' difficulty encoding fractional values.
