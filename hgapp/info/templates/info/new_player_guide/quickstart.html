    The New Players guide has two main features:
    Learning about the game IS learning to play the game.
    Offload tables / reference to the website interface, and use the saved space to SHOW the game via a narrative.

                    This New Player Guide will teach you what The Contract is and how to play it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Experienced Players should use the full Playerâ€™s Guide to reference rules and read about more advanced topics.

                <p>
                    We recommend reading this guide online to take advantage of its interactive components. However, it is also available as a PDF download.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The best way to learn The Contract is to <b>read this guide front to back without skipping anything.</b> The narrative covers the events of one play session and contains critical information.
