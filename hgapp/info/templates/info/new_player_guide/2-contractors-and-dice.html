                The Starlight Motel struck me as the sort of place you ended up after a night of bad decisions.
                Not even that twilight sky--no sun or moon in sight, casting everything in shades of violet-- not even it could turn this parking-lot motel into somewhere that felt safe.
            </p>
            <p>
                I climbed the steps to the second floor and knocked on the door labled <span class="css-typeface">231</span>. No answer. The windows were black.
            </p>
            <p>
                “You’re looking for Bradley,” came a voice from behind. It belonged to a pale teenager wearing a pleather duster and watches on both wrists.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Are you here on Contract?” they asked.

                The click-clacking of cowboy boots echoed up the stairwell. The man attached had one arm, a revolver on each hip, and a mustache that would put Yosemite Sam to shame.

                <p>I chewed on Bo's question. “What am I good at? Causing trouble.”</p>
                <p>“Big surprise. Well, the plane leaves in two hours. Let’s give ‘er a knock and get this show on the road.”</p>
                <p>Five shook their head. “Already knocked. No answer. And the door is locked.”</p>
                <p>“Well shit,” sighed Bo. “Suppose I could go talk to the manager--”</p>
                <p>I set down my backpack and pulled out my crowbar.</p>
                <p>“What in the hell do you think you’re doing, miss?”</p>
                <p>“Causing trouble.”</p>

                <p>
                    I slid the crowbar between the door and its frame and gave a tug. The crackling of wood echoed down the hall, and the door fell off its hinges.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “So much for subtlety,” Bo grumbled, pushing past me into the room. “Bradley? You here, Bradley? Bra-- AGH!” 
                </p>
                <p>
                    A massive creature crashed into the cop, pinning him to the ground. A maw of slavering, razor-sharp fangs opened above him, ready to go for the kill. I raised my crowbar to brain the thing, but Five caught my wrist and flipped on the lights. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    “It appears that Bradley is a dog.”

                </p>
                <p>
                    Bo struggled under Bradley's weight, fending off his kisses. “A dog? Thing’s a gat-dammed bear!” 
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Caucasian mountain dog,” said Five, guiding the beast off of Bo. “It smells like he has been eating roadkill.”

                There was a moment of silence. Bradley’s tongue slid over his razor fangs in a breathless mimicry of panting.

            <p>
                I shook my head. “Wild. I mean, I’ve seen the videos of werewolves and ghosts and shit on YouTube, but none of the vampire ones are confirmed.”

                Bo held up his hand. “Absolutely not. Goin’ viral is the last thing we need. We’ve got a flight to catch, and as far as the US Government is concerned, this thing’s a WMD. Lucy, grab the leash; you’re our handler.”

                Bradley and I boarded first with the elderly and uniformed military personnel. I gave him the window seat, took the aisle for myself, and saved the middle seat for Five.

                Bo slumped into the aisle seat across from mine. “Well color me impressed, Lucy. We made it on board without getting arrested. Now we just have to survive the flight. And the other passengers.”

                “Maybe he will eat my roast beef sandwich,” Five said, rummaging through their bag. Bradley sniffed the sandwich once, coughed, and started licking at the arteries in Five’s wrists.

                I emerged from the bathroom with new blood stains on my jeans carrying a 12 oz water bottle full of what I hoped looked like wine. The line of people waiting in the aisle gave odd looks as I squeezed by.

                Bradley lifted his head to greet me, and I nearly had a heart attack.  A pair of glowing red eyes peered over an upturned, batlike nose. Strands of saliva swung from the tips of needle-sharp fangs that no longer fit behind his lips. 
            </p>
            <p>

                Five uncapped the bottle for Bradley, who proceeded to swallow the meal, bottle and all, with a single chomp. Five was lucky to keep their hand.

                As the dog set to work lapping up any excess splatter, his demonic features receded. Soon, he was back to the big, clumsy teddy bear we’d met in the motel. We breathed a sigh of relief.

                    Creating a custom Power is easy:

                        <li>
                            Envision what you’d like your Contractor to do.

                                <li>Get creative (or steal ideas).</li>

                            Select an <b>Effect</b> that matches your power’s concept.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Effects are starting templates for Powers with defined systems. </li>
                                <li>Examples include: Investigate Individual, Alternate Form, Disguise, and Injure. </li>
                                <li>There are currently 93 Effects to choose from.</li>

                            Customize the Effect with <b>Drawbacks</b>, <b>Enhancements</b>, and <b>Parameters</b>.
                            <ul>
                                <li>All Powers have a Gift cost. </li>
                                <li>Taking an Enhancement or upgrading a Parameter expands the Power’s functionality but costs a Gift.</li>
                                <li>Taking Drawbacks or downgrading a Parameter reduces the Gift cost but makes the Power more situational or risky. </li>

                        </li>

                            Flavor your Power and describe its appearance.
                            <ul>
                                <li>At this point the Power has a system but no identity. </li>
                                <li>Does your Alternate Form Power turn you into a werewolf or a magical girl?</li>
                                <li>Does your Restrict Power fire spiderwebs or summon ghostly chains?</li>
                                <li>Your Power’s Description can have a big impact in-game, but it cannot change the Power’s System.</li>
