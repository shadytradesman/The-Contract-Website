                The Starlight Motel struck me as the kinda place bad things happened. Not even that gorgeous twilight sky--no sun or moon in sight, casting everything above and below in shades of violet-- not even it could turn this parking-lot motel into a place that felt safe. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I climbed the steps to the second floor and knocked on the door of room 231. No answer. The windows were black.

                “You’re looking for Bradley.” The voice came from behind: a pale teen wearing a pleather duster and watches on both wrists.

                Then came the click-clacking of cowboy boots traveling up the stairwell. The man attached had one arm, a revolver on each hip, and a mustache that would put Yosemite Sam to shame. His sheriff’s star winked at me.

                    I slid the crowbar between the door and frame on the hinged side and gave a tug. A snap of cheap wood cracking echoed down the hall, and the door fell off its hinges.

                    A massive creature crashed into the cop, pinning him to the ground. A maw of slavering, razor-sharp fangs opened above him, ready to go for the kill. I raised my crowbar to brain the thing, but Five caught my wrist and flipped on the lights.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Combat in The Contract is quick, unpredictable, and deadly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A successful combat relies more on setting up the right fight than being the best fighter.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The best way to win a fight is with an ambush and/or a numbers advantage.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The system for Combat is easy to learn, but it relies on some mechanics that we have not covered yet.

                In an instant, Bradley the monster was back. His fangs sank into my calf like a dozen steak knives. I remember making a noise, not a scream, something more primal and just as loud. I twisted and kicked. My heel connected with Bradley’s eye, but he didn’t let go.
