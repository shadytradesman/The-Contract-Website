                This story starts at a riot. It wasn’t much: an outraged mob, a few dozen squad cars, police lights flashing off the tear gas and smoke. Hard to believe a little domestic action was enough to get my blood pumping back then.
            </p>
            <p>
                That is, until a rubber bullet caught me in the stomach. Next thing I know, I’m getting cuffed and shoved into the back seat of a squad car. A pair of cops climbed in up front and hit the road with me in tow.
            </p>
            <p>
                We were halfway to the station when she spoke to me. Her voice came over the police radio, but it sounded close, like she was whispering in my ear.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Hate to interrupt your ride, Lucy, but you and I should chat.”
            </p>
            <p>
                The cops glanced at each other. “Uh. . . Dispatch, can you confirm that new destination for Squad 530?”
            </p>
            <p>
