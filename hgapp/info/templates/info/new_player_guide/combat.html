    <b>Combat Basics</b>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Combat in The Contract is quick, unpredictable, and deadly.
        </li>
        <li>
            A successful combat relies more on setting up the right fight than being the best fighter.
        </li>
        <li>
            The best way to win a fight is with an ambush or a numbers advantage.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <b>Going turn-based</b>
    <ul>
        <li>
            When the action comes to a head and many characters want to do something at once, the game enters a turn-based mode called Combat.Â 
        </li>
        <li>
            At the start of Combat each character rolls Initiative (Dexterity + Perception) to determine their place in the turn order.
        </li>
        <li>
            Each Round of turns represents three seconds of in-game action.
        </li>
