            <p>
                Did you know that people have a harder time absorbing html text content than linear document content?
                Well I did not when I wrote the first version of the player's guide, so until I rewrite it in a linear way,
                you can <i>explore</i> the rules <a href="/wiki/rules/">here</a>.
                <br>
                <br>
                Start with <a href="/wiki/Rules/RollingDice/">the basic dice rolling rules</a>, move on to
                <a href="/wiki/Rules/characterelements/">the Character elements</a>, and finish with <a href="/wiki/Rules/Combat/">Combat</a>.

                Step 2: Try Making a Character
            </h2>
            <p>
                If you're going to ask your Players to make Contractors, you should try making one yourself. That's just good leadership.
                <br>

                Step 3: Unlock the Stock Scenarios
            </h2>
            <p>
                {% if not user.is_authenticated %}
                    You're ready to GM! To Unlock the Stock scenarios, you'll have to
                    <a href="{% url 'account_signup' %}" class="btn btn-primary btn-xs">make an account.</a>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Wait a second, we're already at that part? I guess reading the rules was probably most of the work anyway.
                    <br><br>
                    Alright, look. I know you don't want to <a href="{% url 'account_signup' %}" class="btn btn-primary btn-sm">make an account</a>.
                    It's a hassle, and I haven't gotten around to implementing social media log-in yet. But the site's got all
                    these neat features around Scenario visiblity and tracking the Scenarios you've discovered, and
                    you have to  <a href="{% url 'account_signup' %}" class="btn btn-primary">make an account</a> to access that stuff.
                    <br><br>
                    Plus, what if I just put the Scenarios right out in the open for anyone to read? Do you really trust your
                    Players not to sneak a peak and spoil themselves? Even accidentally? This way your Players are protected.
                    They'd have to <a href="{% url 'account_signup' %}" class="btn btn-lg btn-primary">make an account</a> to get access,
                    and if they're half as hesitant as you are, they'll never see 'em.
                    <br><br>
                    Okay, okay, you probably want more info. Well how about this: everyone who's playested the Stock scenarios
                    says they're really fun. That's not a lie either; their enjoyment was genuine. That means you are either going
                    to enjoy the Stock Scenarios or you're going to have the opportunity to be the first person to tell me they suck.
                    That's pretty neat either way.

                    <br><br>
                    That said, you'll need to <a href="{% url 'account_signup' %}" class="btn btn-lg btn-warning">Make an Account</a>
                    to see them!
                {% else %}
                    In order to unlock the Stock Scenarios, you must <a href="{% url 'cells:cells_create' %}">Create a Cell</a>.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Cells are the Player Groups of The Contract, and they make it easy to take advantage of all the recordkeeping
                    features of the site. Creating one takes almost no time at all, so just go ahead and do it if you're
                    planning on GMing the first session for your group!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <a href="{% url 'cells:cells_create' %}" class="btn btn-primary">Create a Cell</a>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Once you create a Cell, you can invite other Players, manage your members' Character Sheets, keep
                    track of world events, record Games that have already occurred, and many other nifty features. Check
                    it out when you have the time.
                {% endif %}

                {% if not user.is_authenticated %}
                    Now that you've made an account, navigate to your
                    <a href="{% url 'games:games_view_scenario_gallery' %}">Scenario Gallery</a> and--
                    <br><br>
                    Hey, wait a minute. You haven't logged in yet! You think you can fool me? I made the whole damn site! Jeeze. . .
                {% else %}
                    Once you've created a Cell, you can view the Stock Scenarios in your
                    <a href="{% url 'games:games_view_scenario_gallery' %}">Scenario Gallery</a>.
                    Yeah, they also need a little polish, but they're certainly playable, so go for it!

                    Step 5: Gather your players
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At this point, you want to gather your other players, have them make Characters (and hopefully accounts)
                    and get them to join your Cell. They don't <i>have to</i> make accounts or join your Cell, but it makes things easier.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Step 6: Play and Record your Game
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Okay. You've got the Stock Scenarios. You know how to GM. Now you can play a Game. There's no need to
                    do anything on the site before you start playing, although you can go through the trouble of using our
                    soon-to-be-drastically-changed <a href="{% url 'games:games_create_game' %}">Game Scheduler</a>.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The most convenient way to record Games is to simply play them, and then visit your Cell and hit the
                    "Declare a Completed Game" button near the top. That allows you to just <i>say</i> what happened instead of
                    having the other Players accept invites and such.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Once you enter the completed Game, your Players will recieve their Gifts (if they won), and you will
                    receive rewards for GMing. Neat!
