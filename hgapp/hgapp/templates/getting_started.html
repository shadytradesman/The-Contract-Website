            <p>
                If you're going to ask your Players to make Contractors, you should try making one yourself. That's just good leadership.

                Step 3: Unlock a Stock Scenario
            </h2>
            <p>
                To Unlock the Stock scenarios, you'll have to
                <a href="{% url 'account_signup' %}" class="btn btn-primary btn-xs">make an account.</a>
                <br>
                <br>
                Wait a second, we're already at that part? I guess reading the rules was probably most of the work anyway.
                <br><br>
                Alright, look. I know you don't want to <a href="{% url 'account_signup' %}" class="btn btn-primary btn-sm">make an account</a>.
                It's a hassle, and I haven't gotten around to implementing social media log-in yet. But the site's got all
                these neat features around Scenario visiblity and tracking the Scenarios you've discovered, and
                you have to  <a href="{% url 'account_signup' %}" class="btn btn-primary">make an account</a> to access that stuff.
                <br><br>
                Plus, what if I just put the Scenarios right out in the open for anyone to read? Do you really trust your
                Players not to sneak a peak and spoil themselves? Even accidentally? This way your Players are protected.
                They'd have to <a href="{% url 'account_signup' %}" class="btn btn-lg btn-primary">make an account</a> to get access,
                and if they're half as hesitant as you are, they'll never see 'em.
                <br><br>
                Okay, okay, you probably want more info. Well how about this: everyone who's playested the Stock scenarios
                says they're really fun. That's not a lie either; their enjoyment was genuine. That means you are either going
                to enjoy the Stock Scenarios or you're going to have the opportunity to be the first person to tell me they suck.
                That's pretty neat either way.

                <br><br>
                That said, you'll need to <a href="{% url 'account_signup' %}" class="btn btn-lg btn-warning">Make an Account</a>
                to see them!
            </p>

                Step 4: Read the Stock Scenarios
            </h2>
            <p>
                Now that you've made an account, navigate to your
                <a href="{% url 'games:games_view_scenario_gallery' %}">Scenario Gallery</a> and--
                <br><br>
                Hey, wait a minute. You haven't logged in yet! You think you can fool me? I made the whole damn site! Jeeze. . .
