                    All new content is available immediately to all Players, and, unlike paper-published RPGs, The
                    Contract is regularly patched as public play reveals balance issues.

                     Automated bookkeeping tools allow you to easily record who attended which Games, how Contractors
                     spent their Gifts and Experience, which Players have seen which Scenarios, and how your World
                     is changing. GMs are given titles that allow you to quickly determine how deadly their Games tend to be.
                     World Leaders can also help their less dedicated players manage their Contractors and Powers.
