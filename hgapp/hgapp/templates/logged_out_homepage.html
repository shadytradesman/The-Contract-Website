                <b>The Contract</b> is a TableTop Role Playing Game about ambitious individuals who agree to go on deadly missions
                in exchange for fantastic Powers.
                Set in a world where the advent of camera phones confirmed the existence of
                the supernatural instead of disproving it, the Contractors operate on the front lines between the mundane and
                extraordinary. Those who survive are forged into some of the most fearsome beings in existence.

                    are rare. Contractors may be asked to win a boxing match against an opponent they cannot beat. They
                    cannot roll dice to win. They must use their creativity, and the incredible freedom empowered by the
                    GM, to blaze their own path to victory. Contractors drug their competitors, blackmail the judges,
                    and doctor the ringside video.

                    <b>Deadly risk.</b> Just how deadly is up to you, but we put our thumb on the scale. GMs are handsomely
                    rewarded for running a Game that achieves the "golden ratio" where at least one Contractor dies while another achieves victory. Players
                    are likewise rewarded when one of their Contractors dies. However, no Game can require a Contractor's death.

                    <b>One Shot at a Time.</b> Built from the ground up to follow Contractors through a series of one-shot
                    sessions, The Contract is well-suited for consistent and shifting groups alike. Contractors are portable,
                    but each Player Group (Cell) has its own world for Contractors to build (or destroy). The downtimes
                    between Games are often just as important as the Games themselves.
