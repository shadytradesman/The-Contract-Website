                <b>The Contract</b> is a TableTop Role Playing Game about ambitious individuals who agree to go on deadly missions
                in exchange for fantastic Powers.
                Set in a world where the advent of camera phones confirmed the existence of
                the supernatural instead of disproving it, the Contractors operate on the front lines between the mundane and
                extraordinary. Those who survive are forged into some of the most fearsome beings in existence.

                    <b>Free and Accessible.</b> The Contract is available in its entirety for free on this website.
                    All new content is available immediately to all Players, and, unlike paper-published RPGs, The
                    Contract is regularly patched as public play reveals balance issues.

                     Automated bookkeeping tools allow you to easily record who attended which Games, how Contractors
                     spent their Gifts and Experience, which Players have seen which Scenarios, and how your Cell's world
                     is changing. GMs are given titles that allow you to quickly determine how deadly their Games tend to be.
                     Cell Leaders can also help their less dedicated players manage their Contractors and Powers.

                    do not offer maps, tokens, communal dice-rolling, or similar features. We recommend using either a
                    real tabletop, Roll20, or Discord with The Contract's site.
